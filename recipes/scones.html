            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
            <li>freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>8 leaves fresh sage</li>
            <p>Scones</p>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, frozen and grated</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped walnuts, lightly toasted</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Gruyere cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage</li>
            <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
                Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Step 2
                For the topping, melt butter in a pan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring often, until the milk solids turn golden brown and the butter smells nutty, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour butter and any browned bits into a small bowl and allow to cool to room temperature. Whisk in the heavy cream and set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 3
                For the scones, whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder together in a large mixing bowl. Add grated butter and work into the flour mixture using your fingertips until well distributed and the mixture feels crumbly/mealy. Using a wooden spoon, stir in walnuts, Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses, and sage, making sure all ingredients are evenly distributed. Place in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <li>Step 4
                Add pumpkin to a separate small mixing bowl. Using a paper towel, dab the pumpkin puree to soak up as much excess moisture as you can. Whisk in heavy cream and egg until the mixture is evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Step 5
                Drizzle the pumpkin mixture over the flour mixture. Stir with a rubber spatula until the flour mixture is thoroughly moistened and a crumbly dough forms; do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Step 6
                Using lightly floured hands, gather the dough and gently knead in the mixing bowl until it just comes together. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and form into a 7- to 8-inch-round disc. Cut the disc into 8 equal wedges. Transfer the wedges to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Step 7
                Generously brush each scone with the brown butter and cream topping mixture and sprinkle with cracked black pepper as desired. Place 1 sage leaf on top of each scone and press gently to adhere.</li>
            <li>Step 8
                Bake in the preheated oven until scones are lightly browned, 20 to 23 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.</li>
